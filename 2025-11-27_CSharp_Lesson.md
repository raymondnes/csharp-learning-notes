# C# Mastery: 3-Month Plan
## Date: 2025-11-27
### Month 1, Week 1, Day 3: Operators and Expressions

**Session Status:** Completed

**Today's Goals:**
- Understanding arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %)
- Understanding comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=)
- Understanding logical operators (&&, ||, !)
- Operator precedence and evaluation order
- Compound assignment operators (+=, -=, *=, /=, %=)

## **Session Summary**

**Date:** November 27, 2025

Today's session covered Day 2 content - Variables and Data Types, which was completed successfully with all 9 Test_Agent assessment levels passed.

**Topics Covered:**
- Variables as labeled containers for data
- Fundamental data types: `int`, `string`, `double`, `bool`, `decimal`
- Variable declaration syntax: `type variableName = value;`
- Variable reassignment vs declaration
- String interpolation: `$"text {variable}"`
- Type inference with `var`
- Static typing and type safety
- camelCase naming conventions
- Type conversion and casting
- String formatting and precision

**Key Achievements:**
- Completed comprehensive Socratic dialogue on variables and data types
- Successfully passed all 9 levels of Test_Agent progressive assessment
- Demonstrated professional coding practices (using `decimal` for financial calculations)
- Showed curiosity by independently experimenting with `var` and discovering type safety
- Learned about string padding methods (`PadLeft()`, `PadRight()`) as a bonus topic

**Student Insights:**
- "C# holds you to your word" - excellent understanding of static typing
- Recognized the importance of naming conventions for collaboration and clean code
- Identified the tradeoff between `var` and explicit types (readability vs. brevity)

**Next Session Preview:**
Day 3 will cover Operators and Expressions - learning how to perform calculations, comparisons, and logical operations with variables.
