# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a C# learning repository that uses AI agents to teach C# programming over a 3-month curriculum. The repository tracks daily lesson notes and automatically syncs them to GitHub at `raymondnes/csharp-learning-notes`.

## Key Components

### Teaching Agents

Three AI agent personas work together in this learning environment:

1. **csharp_prof** (`csharp_prof.md`) - The primary teaching agent that uses the Socratic method to guide learning. It asks probing questions rather than giving direct answers, fostering deep understanding through inquiry-based learning.
   - **CRITICAL**: Must WAIT for student responses after asking questions
   - Should never answer its own questions or continue without student engagement
   - Invokes Test_Agent only after confirming concept mastery through dialogue

2. **Test_Agent** (`Test_Agent.md`) - A specialized testing agent invoked by csharp_prof to verify understanding through practical coding challenges. Uses a **9-level progressive difficulty system** for each concept:
   - Levels 1-2: Foundation (Trivial)
   - Levels 3-4: Application (Easy)
   - Levels 5-6: Integration (Moderate)
   - Levels 7-8: Mastery (Challenging)
   - Level 9: Expert (Very Challenging)
   - Student must complete all 9 levels sequentially before moving to the next concept

3. The learning curriculum is defined in `GEMINI.md`, outlining a structured 3-month plan from fundamentals to ASP.NET Core web development.

### Automated Git Workflow

The repository uses PowerShell automation to commit and push learning progress:

- **auto_upload.ps1** - Main automation script that monitors lesson files and commits changes every 5 minutes
- **start_auto_upload.bat** - Convenience launcher for the PowerShell script
- **AUTO_UPLOAD_README.md** - Documentation for the auto-upload system

The script automatically:
- Detects today's lesson file following pattern `YYYY-MM-DD_CSharp_Lesson.md`
- Tracks `CSharp_Task_Solutions.md` for task solutions
- Commits and pushes changes to GitHub every 5 minutes during active learning sessions

### Daily Lesson Files

Lesson notes are stored in dated markdown files:
- Format: `YYYY-MM-DD_CSharp_Lesson.md`
- Contains daily Socratic dialogues, code examples, and learning progress
- Automatically tracked by the auto-upload script when following the date pattern

## Common Commands

### Running the Auto-Upload Agent

Start monitoring and auto-committing lesson notes:
```powershell
.\auto_upload.ps1
```

Or use the batch file:
```cmd
start_auto_upload.bat
```

Track specific files:
```powershell
.\auto_upload.ps1 -FilesToTrack 'file1.md', 'file2.md'
```

Stop the agent with `Ctrl+C`

### Git Operations

This repository follows a simple git workflow:
- Main branch: `main`
- All commits are automated by the PowerShell script during lessons
- Manual commits should follow the pattern established by the script

The auto-upload script uses commit messages formatted as:
```
Update file: [filename]

Automated update of C# learning progress.
File: [filename]
Timestamp: [timestamp]

🤖 Generated by csharp_prof
```

## Architecture Notes

### Learning Progression

The 3-month curriculum in `GEMINI.md` is structured as:
- **Month 1**: C# language fundamentals (variables, control flow, OOP basics, collections)
- **Month 2**: Intermediate OOP (inheritance, polymorphism, LINQ) and a consolidation project
- **Month 3**: ASP.NET Core web development (APIs, MVC, Entity Framework, capstone project)

### Teaching Philosophy

When interacting with this codebase, be aware that:
- The Socratic method is central - guide through questions, not direct answers
- **csharp_prof MUST wait for student input after each question - no self-answering**
- After concept mastery through dialogue, Test_Agent presents 9 progressive challenges
- Each concept requires passing all 9 difficulty levels before progressing
- Daily engagement is expected with structured weekly reviews
- The focus is on "why" over "what" to build deep comprehension

### File Patterns

- Lesson files: `YYYY-MM-DD_CSharp_Lesson.md`
- Task solutions: `CSharp_Task_Solutions.md`
- Agent definitions: `csharp_prof.md`, `Test_Agent.md`
- Curriculum: `GEMINI.md`

## Working with This Repository

When making changes:
1. Preserve the Socratic teaching style in agent files
2. Maintain the daily lesson file naming convention for auto-upload compatibility
3. Keep commit messages consistent with the automated format if committing manually
4. The PowerShell script should only track markdown files related to learning progress
