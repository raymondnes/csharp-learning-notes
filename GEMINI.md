# C# Mastery in 3 Months: A Foundational Approach

## Project Overview

This document outlines a structured, daily-focused 3-month learning plan to guide you from the fundamentals of C# to building professional applications. This curriculum is designed to build a strong, unshakeable foundation in programming and software development with .NET.

Our learning will be guided by `csharp_prof` in a Socratic style.

## Month 1: The Foundation - C# Language Fundamentals

**Goal:** To build a rock-solid understanding of the core C# language features and fundamental programming concepts.

*   **Week 1: Basic Building Blocks**
    *   **Day 1:** Setting up your environment, using the .NET CLI, and writing your first "Hello, World!" application.
    *   **Day 2:** Understanding variables and the most common built-in data types (`int`, `string`, `bool`, `double`).
    *   **Day 3:** Performing calculations with arithmetic operators and assigning values.
    *   **Day 4:** Getting user input with `Console.ReadLine()` and converting between types (type casting).
    *   **Day 5:** Weekly Review & Project: Build a Basic Command-Line Calculator.
*   **Week 2: Controlling Program Flow**
    *   **Day 6:** Making decisions with `if-else` statements and using comparison operators.
    *   **Day 7:** Simplifying complex choices with `switch` statements.
    *   **Day 8:** Repeating actions a specific number of times with `for` loops.
    *   **Day 9:** Repeating actions based on a condition with `while` and `do-while` loops.
    *   **Day 10:** Weekly Review & Project: Build a Number Guessing Game.
*   **Week 3: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
    *   **Day 11:** Writing and calling your first methods to organize code.
    *   **Day 12:** Understanding method parameters, arguments, and return values.
    *   **Day 13:** Defining your first `class` and creating an object (`instance`).
    *   **Day 14:** Initializing objects with constructors and using the `this` keyword.
    *   **Day 15:** Weekly Review & Project: Design and implement a `Player` class for a role-playing game.
*   **Week 4: Collections and Error Handling**
    *   **Day 16:** Storing sequences of data in Arrays.
    *   **Day 17:** Using the more flexible `List<T>` for dynamic collections.
    *   **Day 18:** Iterating over collections easily with `foreach` loops.
    *   **Day 19:** Handling potential runtime errors gracefully with `try-catch` blocks.
    *   **Day 20:** Weekly Review & Project: Build a simple student roster management application.

## Month 2: The Craftsman - Intermediate C# & OOP

**Goal:** To move beyond the basics and master the principles of object-oriented design, enabling you to write clean, reusable, and professional-grade code.

*   **Week 5: Deepening Your OOP Knowledge**
    *   **Day 21:** Creating robust classes with Properties (`get`, `set`) and understanding encapsulation.
    *   **Day 22:** Differentiating between `static` members (class-level) and instance members (object-level).
    *   **Day 23:** Reusing code with Inheritance (creating `base` and `derived` classes).
    *   **Day 24:** Achieving Polymorphism with `virtual` and `override` methods.
    *   **Day 25:** Weekly Review & Project: Build a `Vehicle` hierarchy (e.g., `Car`, `Bicycle` inheriting from `Vehicle`).
*   **Week 6: Abstraction and Data Processing**
    *   **Day 26:** Defining blueprints with `abstract` classes.
    *   **Day 27:** Defining contracts with `interfaces`.
    *   **Day 28:** Managing key-value data with `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>`.
    *   **Day 29:** Introduction to LINQ for powerful data querying (`Where`, `Select`, `OrderBy`).
    *   **Day 30:** Weekly Review & Project: Build a query tool for a product inventory.
*   **Weeks 7 & 8: Consolidation Project**
    *   These two weeks will be dedicated to building a single, larger console application that requires you to combine all the concepts learned so far. This will be a significant project, such as a text-based adventure game, a personal finance tracker, or a small library management system. We will build it step-by-step, day-by-day.

## Month 3: The Builder - Web Development with ASP.NET Core

**Goal:** To apply your C# skills to build modern, real-world backend applications and web APIs.

*   **Week 9: Your First Web API**
    *   **Day ~45:** Understanding the fundamentals of HTTP (requests, responses, methods) and what an API is.
    *   **Day ~46:** Creating a "Minimal API" project in .NET.
    *   **Day ~47:** Learning about routing and returning data as JSON.
    *   **Day ~48:** Handling incoming data with `GET` and `POST` requests.
    *   **Day ~49:** Weekly Review & Project: Build a simple "To-Do List" API that stores data in memory.
*   **Week 10: Architecting Your API**
    *   **Day ~50:** Understanding the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern and its use in APIs.
    *   **Day ~51:** Learning the "why" and "how" of Dependency Injection (DI).
    *   **Day ~52:** Separating concerns by creating a "service layer" for your business logic.
    *   **Day ~53:** Refactoring your API to use MVC Controllers and DI services.
    *   **Day ~54:** Weekly Review & Project: Re-architecting the To-Do API to follow professional standards.
*   **Week 11: Connecting to a Real Database**
    *   **Day ~55:** Introduction to Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) with Entity Framework (EF) Core.
    *   **Day ~56:** Defining your data models and creating a `DbContext`.
    *   **Day ~57:** Using EF Core migrations to create and manage your database schema safely.
    *   **Day ~58:** Replacing in-memory data with real database CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
    *   **Day ~59:** Weekly Review & Project: Create a Blog API with a persistent database for posts and comments.
*   **Week 12: Final Capstone Project**
    *   The final week (or more) will be dedicated to a capstone project of your choosing, allowing you to design and build a complete, portfolio-ready backend application from scratch, applying everything you have learned throughout the three months.
