# C# Lesson: 2025-11-23

## Concept: The "Hello, World!" Program

**Professor's Question:** In C#, if you wanted to display a message on the console, what kind of instruction do you think you would need to give it? What would be the key components of such an instruction?

**Student's Response:** it will need a type format, variable value and an output command

## Concept: Data Types

**Professor's Question:** You mentioned "type format." In C#, when we talk about "type," what do you imagine that refers to? What is its purpose in a programming language, and why might it be important for the computer to know the "type" of something?

**Student's Response:** type to me means something that represents the identity of a given value.

**Professor's Response:** That's a fantastic way to put it! "The identity of a given value" is a very insightful definition. It gets to the heart of the matter.

In C#, a 	ype tells the computer both the *kind* of data it is (a number, text, a true/false value, etc.) and what you can *do* with that data. For example, you can perform division on two numbers, but you can't divide two pieces of text. The type defines the data's identity, just as you said, and its capabilities.

This brings us to our next question: If we want to store a piece of text like "Hello, World!", what 	ype do you think C# would use to represent it? And for a whole number, like 5, what 	ype might that be?
