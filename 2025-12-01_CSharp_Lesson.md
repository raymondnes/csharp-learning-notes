# C# Mastery: 3-Month Plan
## Date: 2025-12-01
### Month 1, Week 1, Day 5: Weekly Review & Command-Line Calculator Project

**Session Status:** Active

**Today's Goals:**
- Review all concepts from Week 1 (Days 1-4)
- Synthesize learning by building a practical application
- Create a command-line calculator that combines:
  - User input (Day 4)
  - Type conversion and parsing (Day 4)
  - Operators and expressions (Day 3)
  - Variables and data types (Day 2)
  - Console output (Day 1)
- Apply problem-solving skills to a real-world scenario
- Practice decision-making in program design

## **Professor's Opening Dialogue**

Welcome to Day 5 - your first weekly review and project day!

You've had an incredible first week. Let's recap what you've accomplished:

- **Day 1**: You mastered the .NET CLI, learned `Console.Write()` vs `Console.WriteLine()`, and wrote your first C# programs
- **Day 2**: You conquered variables, data types (`int`, `string`, `bool`, `double`, `decimal`), string interpolation, and the `var` keyword
- **Day 3**: You mastered operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical, compound assignment) and operator precedence
- **Day 4**: You made programs interactive with `Console.ReadLine()` and learned type parsing (`int.Parse()`, `double.Parse()`)

And you didn't just learn these concepts - you **mastered** them, passing all 36 Test_Agent challenges with a 100% overall pass rate!

Today is different from the previous days. Instead of learning new concepts through Socratic dialogue and then being tested, you're going to **apply everything you've learned** by building a real, practical application: a **Command-Line Calculator**.

This calculator will allow users to:
1. Choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
2. Enter two numbers
3. See the calculated result
4. Perform multiple calculations in a session

Before we start building, let me ask you a foundational question:

**Professor's Socratic Question (Project Planning):**

Think about all the calculators you've used - on your phone, computer, or even a physical calculator. What makes a calculator **useful** to a user?

In other words, what features or behaviors would make someone want to use your command-line calculator instead of just doing the math in their head?
